# data-visualization-challenge
Module 5 challenge


In this assignment we reinforced our ability to manipulate pandas DataFrames. Using the data we read in from two csv files, we cleaned up the data,
performed a variety of calcuations, and visually represented the data using a variety of techniques. We practiced creating data visualisations using
both pandas and matplotlib. This reinforced the idea that we need to use like data with like data. Pandas DataFrames can create visualisations with 
pandas commands. Matplotlib uses series.
